ClientGame instantiates a ClientGame::ParticleEmitter, which is a ClientGame::GameObject as-well as a Renderer::Renderable
	ParticleEmitter maintains a pool of Renderer::Particle objects
		this pool is guaranteed to be contiguous memory, and must be iterated via index up to numParticles
		when a particle is no longer wanted, it is swapped with the last living particle and marked dead, then particle count is decreased
	ParticleEmitter is fully responsible for its Particle objects - it must create, update, render and destroy them
